# Core Development Rules
- Always use the get_logger function from src/utils/logger.py for logging.
- Always use models from config['LLM_MODELS'] instead of hardcoded model names.
- Use LangChain's high-level interfaces when possible for simplicity.

# Data Management
- Use Pydantic models for data validation.
- Keep MongoDB queries simple - avoid complex aggregations when possible.

# Frontend Guidelines
- Use Material-UI (MUI) components instead of custom CSS when possible.
- Use TypeScript for better type safety.

# Remember
- This is a personal project - favor simplicity over complexity.
- Don't over-engineer - implement only what you need.
