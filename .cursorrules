- Always use the get_logger function from src/utils/logger.py for logging.
- Always use models from config['LLM_MODELS'] instead of hardcoded model names.
- Use LangChain's high-level interfaces when possible for simplicity.
- Keep MongoDB queries simple - avoid complex aggregations when possible.
- Use Material-UI (MUI) components instead of custom CSS when possible.
- This is a personal project - favor simplicity over complexity. Don't over-engineer - implement only what you need.
- Always place new code logically within the file, ensuring it follows a coherent order rather than being added randomly or at the bottom.
